**NLW Expert Burguer App** is a simple go-to burguer. This project was developed as part of a hands-on session during the React Native in Practice event (Rocketseat), leveraging Expo for streamlined cross-platform development.

## Technology

The following are the key technologies and tools used in the development of this app:

- **React Native**: It's a mobile app development framework that allows you to build native apps for iOS and Android using JavaScript and React. It enables mobile app development with a single codebase, providing a native user experience.
- **Expo**: It's an open-source platform and set of tools for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React Native. Expo provides a range of ready-to-use components and APIs that streamline app development, including access to features like camera, geolocation, and push notifications.
- **Expo Router**: The Expo router is not a standalone library or module, but rather a part of the Expo SDK that facilitates navigation between screens in React Native apps built with Expo. It provides a simplified and declarative way to manage navigation within an app, allowing developers to define routes and navigate between them using components like StackNavigator, TabNavigator, and DrawerNavigator.
- **Nativewind**: NativeWind uses Tailwind CSS as scripting language to create a universal style system for React Native. NativeWind components can be shared between platforms and will output their styles as CSS StyleSheet on web and StyleSheet.create for native.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.
- **React Native Async Storage**: AsyncStorage allows applications to efficiently save data locally and access that data in future sessions.
- **Clsx**: Is generally used to conditionally apply a given className

## How It Works

**NLW Export Burguer** is your go-to burger ordering platform. Browse the menu, select your favorite burger, add it to your cart, and check out with ease. Finalize your order, and it's sent to WhatsApp for a seamless test order experience.

### Home

The home screen of our NLW Expert Burguer App features a mouthwatering menu of burgers, neatly categorized into sections like "Burger of the Day," "Promotions," "Desserts," and "Beverages." Users can easily navigate through these sections using a convenient filter option, allowing them to scroll directly to their desired category. Each burger option is presented as a clickable button, enticing users to explore further by redirecting them to the detailed order page.

### Burguer details

The Burger Details screen, users are presented with a comprehensive overview of the selected burger, including detailed information such as ingredients, size options, and pricing. Additionally, a prominent "Add to Cart" button allows users to effortlessly add the burger to their order.

### Cart

The Cart screen, users can review all the burgers added to their order, along with a summary of the total purchase amount. Additionally, there is a convenient field for users to input their address for delivery. At the bottom of the screen, a prominent "Checkout" button allows users to finalize their purchase. Upon clicking this button, the order details are automatically sent to a test WhatsApp number.
